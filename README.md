# Multiarch Image for Podsync

This Repo is solely for me having a arm64 image for [Podsync](https://github.com/mxpv/podsync). It includes a TravisCI Pipeline to build Podsync for AMD64, ARM64, ARMv6 and ARMv7. Use it at your own risk. No warranty. No support.

If you'd like to use it, see here: https://hub.docker.com/r/tdeutsch/podsync/tags

Or here: https://quay.io/repository/tdeutsch/podsync?tab=tags
